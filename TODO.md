# TODO: Remove Custom Card CSS and Implement Bootstrap Cards

- [x] Remove all card-related CSS styles from `public/css/style.css` (selectors: .card, .card-image, .card-content, .card-title, .card-author, .card-excerpt, .card-btn)
- [x] Update `views/home.ejs` to replace custom card markup with Bootstrap card classes and make the grid responsive using Bootstrap's row and col classes
- [x] Verify Bootstrap CSS is linked in `views/home.ejs` (add if missing)
- [x] Test the page for responsiveness and layout issues
